# Project Abstract

**FixAI** is an **AI-powered platform** designed to improve how urban infrastructure issues are detected, classified, and resolved. It establishes a feedback loop between citizens and municipal authorities by combining user-submitted reports with automated backend analysis. The platform includes a **mobile app** for the public and a **desktop interface** for city operators.

The mobile app allows users to report issues by taking a photo, after which the system extracts metadata (e.g., geolocation), uses **AI to classify the incident, assess severity, and generate structured descriptions**. A personal dashboard lets users track the status of their reports and view issues in list or map format.

For city operators, the desktop interface acts as a control center. It features customizable dashboards, detailed incident pages, and a dynamic map with filtering and heatmap functionality. **To reduce redundancy, FixAI groups related reports** into single incidents using geospatial indexing (via the H3 framework) and AI-based similarity detection.

By streamlining reporting and analysis, FixAI fosters efficient urban governance and promotes citizen engagement. The platform supports data-informed decisions for infrastructure maintenance and urban planning, offering a **scalable model for smart city management**.
