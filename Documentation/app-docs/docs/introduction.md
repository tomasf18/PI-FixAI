# Introduction

**FixAI** is an AI-powered collaborative platform designed to improve urban safety and incident resolution through citizen participation and automated detection. This project is being developed as part of the **Projeto em Informática (PI)** course. The main objective is not only to deliver a final product but also to emphasize the software development process, including system architecture, AI integration, and usability testing.

To effectively manage our development process, we will implement tools and practices such as:

- **Backlog Management**: Tracking tasks to ensure organized progress.
- **Docusaurus**: Maintaining comprehensive documentation.
- **GitHub Workflow**: Defined for each commit, issue, branches and pull requests.

Additionally, **weekly meetings** will be held to facilitate organization and communication within the team and can be located in Docusaurus’ documentation.

By prioritizing collaboration and clear communication, we aim to maintain a structured workflow that emphasizes continuous testing, integration, and validation of each module while ensuring alignment with the project objectives.
