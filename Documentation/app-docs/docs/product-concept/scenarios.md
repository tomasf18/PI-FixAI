The following context scenarios illustrate how the **AI-Powered Platform for Smart City Issue Detection & Resolution** integrates into the daily activities of its users, helping them achieve their goals.

## Scenario 1: João Reports a Pothole

While commuting to work, João notices a large pothole on the road. He opens the municipal mobile application, takes a photo of the pothole, and confirms the detected location. The integrated AI module then automatically generates a brief and contextually accurate description (e.g., "Large pothole on Main Street") and categorizes the problem based on its type. João reviews the generated information and submits the report. The entire process takes less than a minute, leaving João satisfied with the ease and efficiency of contributing to urban improvement.

**Underlined Actions**: _opens the municipal app_; _takes a photo_; _confirms location_; _reviews AI-generated description and category_; _submits the report_.

## Scenario 2: João Checks the Status of a Previously Reported Incident

On his way home, João recalls having reported a broken streetlight in his neighborhood two weeks earlier. To follow up, he opens the mobile application and navigates to the “My Reports” section. The interface provides two modes of visualization: a list of all previously submitted reports along with their current statuses—“Pending,” “In Progress,” or “Resolved”—and a map view displaying all incidents with geospatial markers. João quickly locates the streetlight incident and sees that its status has been updated to “In Progress,” indicating that the municipal services are actively addressing the issue.

**Underlined Actions**: _opens the app_; _navigates to "My Reports"_; _locates the incident_; _checks the current status_.

## Scenario 3: Ana Reviews Daily Incident Reports

Midway through her workday, Ana logs into the city control center's desktop-based platform to review all new incident reports submitted that day. The dashboard presents incidents grouped by type, resolution status, and severity. Upon filtering the reports, she notices a series of unresolved pothole incidents across various city districts. Based on this overview, Ana allocates the appropriate municipal teams to the affected areas and updates the incident statuses to “In Progress”.


**Underlined Actions**: _logs into the control center platform_; _filters incidents by category and status_; _identifies unresolved cases_; _delegates tasks to appropriate teams_; _updates incident statuses_.

## Scenario 4: Ana Manages a Surge of Reports Following a Storm

After a severe storm, Ana monitors the city’s incident management platform to assess urban damage. The dashboard, which aggregates real-time citizen reports, indicates over 200 newly submitted cases, including flooding, fallen trees, damaged sidewalks, and traffic signal malfunctions. She contacts municipal repair crews to address the most critical situations first and updates the status of the selected reports to “In Progress”.

**Underlined Actions**: _accesses the incident management dashboard_; _reviews citizen reports_; _dispatches repair crews_; _updates incident statuses_.
