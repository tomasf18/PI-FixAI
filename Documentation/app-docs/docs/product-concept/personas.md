The design and development of the **AI-Powered Platform for Smart City Issue Detection & Resolution** were supported by several Personas that represent the key users of the application. These include:

- **João**, a Local Resident (Box 1)
- **Ana**, a Municipal Employee (Box 2)
- **Ricardo**, a System Administrator (Box 3)

## Box 1. João, a Local Resident

![João, a Local Resident](../../static/img/personas/citizen.jpg)

**João** is a 35-year-old local resident who frequently commutes within the city and wants to contribute to the improvement of urban safety by reporting incidents such as potholes, accidents, or vandalism.

João is **frustrated** with unresponsive, slow, and impractical municipal services when reporting issues. He also finds it difficult to track the resolution of reported problems, leading to a sense of inefficiency in city maintenance.

**NEEDS**: João wants an **easy-to-use and fast mobile app** to submit incident reports. He also needs **feedback** on whether the incident has been addressed and the ability to **check the status** of his reported issues, as well as a history of past reports.

## Box 2. Ana, a Municipal Employee

![Ana, a Municipal Employee](../../static/img/personas/municipal_employee.jpg)

**Ana** is a 45-year-old municipal employee working in the city's urban management department. She is responsible for monitoring reported incidents and coordinating the appropriate response from service teams.

Ana is **overwhelmed** by the high volume of duplicate and unstructured reports, and she struggles to **prioritize** incidents effectively due to the lack of categorization and real-time updates. She also finds it challenging to maintain a clear overview of all active incidents across the city.

**NEEDS**: Ana wants a **centralized dashboard** that offers a comprehensive view of all reported issues. She needs **automated tools** to help cluster similar reports, **filter by category or urgency**, and access **visual insights** like maps and statistics to support efficient decision-making.
