This section presents the **user stories** that define the core functionalities of the system, ensuring that the platform meets the needs of **citizens** and **city control operators**.

## Citizen User Stories

- **As a citizen**, I want to easily submit reports of urban issues (e.g., potholes, fallen trees, vandalism) through a mobile app, so that the city can quickly address them.
- **As a citizen**, I want to receive a suggested description and category for the problem in the photo, so that I can report a problem in less than one minute.
- **As a citizen**, I want to check the status of my reported issues and access a history of my past reports, so that I can track their resolution process.
- **As a citizen**, I want to track status of my reported issue changes to "Resolved", so that I stay informed about its progress.

## City Control Operator User Stories

- **As a city control operator**, I want to access a centralized dashboard that organizes all reported incidents by category and statuses, so that I can efficiently manage, and track the resolution of issues across the city.
- **As a city control operator**, I want to filter reports based on status (e.g., pending, in progress, resolved) and/or on category, so that I can efficiently manage and monitor incidents with a more organized view.
- **As a city control operator**, I want to access all reports and images related to the same issue in a specific location, so that I can assess the problem from multiple perspectives, reduce redundancy, and avoid duplicate efforts.
- **As a city control operator**, I want to visualize incidents on a live city map, so that I can quickly identify affected areas and coordinate response teams.
- **As a city control operator**, I want to update the status of incidents in real time, so that citizens can see the progress.
