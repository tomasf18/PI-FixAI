This section provides an analysis of existing solutions in the field of issue-reporting platforms, highlighting their limitations and areas for improvement.

## Na Minha Rua Lx 
- **No automatic location detection** – Users must manually enter the address, which can be inaccurate.
- **No smart categorization** – Users need to manually select the problem category without AI-powered suggestions.
- **No AI-generated descriptions** – Users must type the issue manually, with no intelligent assistance.  
- All these issues can make the reporting process more time-consuming and complicated, potentially discouraging users from submitting a report.

## GovPilot
- **No issue clustering** – Similar reports in the same area are not grouped, potentially leading to duplicate efforts and redundant reports.
- **No priority-based categorization** – There’s no mention of urgency levels, meaning critical issues might not be prioritized appropriately.
- **No integration with AI or automated processing** – The process seems entirely manual, lacking smart automation to streamline reporting and response times.

## A Minha Rua (gov.pt)
- **No option to upload photos** – Users can only provide a written description without attaching images for better context.
- **No automatic location detection** – Users must manually enter the address, which can be inaccurate.
- **No smart categorization** – Users need to manually select the problem category without AI-powered suggestions.
- **No real-time status updates** – The system does not indicate whether the issue has already been reported or is being resolved.
- **No AI-generated descriptions** – Users must type the issue manually, with no intelligent assistance.
- **Outdated interface** – Simple and functional design but lacks interactive or visually appealing elements.
